### Payment Terms
Credit Control functionality controls payment terms through „Due Date Calculation“ field. It does not apply, if on Sales Order there is payment term where „Due Date Calculation“ is 0. 
For example: customer has overdue invoices, but wants to pay by card or in cash. In that case, the Credit Control will not be applied.
