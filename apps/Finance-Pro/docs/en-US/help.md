## Setup  
### Deferred entries  
To use line descriptions from sales/purchase documents, please enable "Add Line Description to Deferral Entries" in "Sales & Receivables Setup" and/or "Purchases & Payables Setup".
When using general journals no setup is needed (meaning journal line description is always added to deferral schedule lines description).
