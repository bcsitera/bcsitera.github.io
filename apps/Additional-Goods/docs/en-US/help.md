## Settings

You must set up Additional Items for every different combination you use in your sale procsess.

### Additional Items Setup

Before you can manage Customer specific rules it is wise to define general policy for Additional Items and Deposits. You must define the general setup on the
**Additional Items Setup** page. This general setup is typically performed once during the initial implementation. On General FastTab you must select separately how
Additional Items and Deposit are gonna be added on document lines.

|Additional Items Calculation|Explanation|
|---|---| 
| Add After Each Item | Adds Additional Items as new lines after the main product line |
| Document Total At The End | Sums Additional Items at the end of the document lines per item code |

For Deposit calculations you can choose between following options:

|Deposit Calculation|Explanation|
|---|---| 
| Add After Each Item | Adds Deposit as a new line after the main product line |
| Document Total At The End | Sums Deposits at the end of the document lines per deposit code |

If **Add Additional Items at Document Release** and/or **Add Deposit at Document Release** are enabled operations are done automatically on documents.


If all the previous selections are done you have to enable on which documents you want to use the functionality.<br>
**Calculate on Order** - functionality is enabled on Sales Orders <br>
**Calculate on Invoice** - functionality is enabled on Sales Invoices <br>
**Calculate on Credit Memo** - functionality is enabled on Sales Credit Memos <br>


### Settings on Customer Card

In addition for general setup you can specify the customer specific rules on the Customer Card. To do that open the Customer Card and on **Shipping** FastTab you can
choose between following options for Additional Items:

|Additional Items Calculation|Explanation|
|---|---|

| Total At The End | Sums Deposits at the end of the document lines per deposit code |


 ### Additional Item Groups

Additional Items are dependent on the Items you sell. Instead of defining Additional Items to every Customer separately you can create groups. These are called
**Additional Item Groups**. In these groups you define which additional items are always sold together.
Choose search and enter **Additional Item Groups**. To create a new group select **New > give it a Code and Description**. After that select **Actions > Additional
Items**. Additional Items page opens. Fill out the lines with items which are additional to the main item. Description for fields are following: <br>
**Item no** - Additional Item item no<br>
**Quantity (base)** - quantity per base unit <br>
**Type** - type of Additional Item (optional) <br>
**Deposit** - shows if the item acts as a Deposit, taken from Item card field <br>
 
 
### Settings on Item Card

Finally you have to define which Additional Items are connected to main item. For this go to the main Item Card and on FastTab **Additional Items/Deposit** choose
on the field **Additional Items** additional item group what you have defined previously.

If Item Card itself is Deposit, following parameters must be applied: **Type = Non-Inventory** and **Deposit == Yes**.
 
 

### Customer Units of Measure

Sometimes you might have different pallet quantities for different Customers. In order Additional Item Group Quantity (base) to work you must define those differences
in **Customer Units of Measure** page.

|Field|Explanation|
|---|---| 
| Customer No | Customer no to whom exception applies |
| Item No | Item no to which exception applies |
| Unit of Measure Code | Unit of Measure to which exception applies in Item Units of Measure page |

NB! All Units of Measure and Quantities must be set up previously on **Item Units of Measure** page.
